## Favorite CPCS 120L Labs
#Lab 2 : Part 1

Although this lab was insanely quick and easy, I am still fond of it because it was a great time meeting my classmates. The lab was also a smooth introduction into some simple yet fun code. To be able to affect the output through input for the first time was also great and I think is one of the best labs for its simplicity.

#Lab 3 : Part 2

This lab was my second personal best not only because of my partner making it a great time but also because of how much we overcomplicated it just to find out the answer was right in front of us the whole time. We were trying to find a way to calculate the days and account for leap years and whatever else. But in all reality the provided Julian day function was what we had to call and that was it.

#Lab 4 : Part 1

Something about this lab made it so cohesive that I just have to consider it my third favorite lab. I believe it was also the first lab where my partner and I finished much earlier than anyone else. Just the way that we were able to make the functions and call them all at once at the end was just a nice feeling.
